# Card-Game
A text based java game that uses my own implemenations of an ArrayList, linked list, and a queue(created using the linked list).
At the start of the game we deal cards to 4 players the players place their card on the table and the player who has the highest value keeps all the cards. 
The player who has the most cards is the winner, 2-way, 3-way, 4-way ties are all possible and are handled by the program.
